# binconv
Tool for formatting binaries to multiple programming languages

## QA
### Why?
Some embedded programmers like to append binaries files into their programs, so they don't need a filesystem for it. Since it's hard to convert massive files manually, i've made this tool.
### How?
Just type ``binconv --help`` and it's gonna explain you.
